Spring 2019 Virtual Reality Tutorial

## Introduction
This repository contains many powerpoint tutorials and their respective projects to help you get started and learn how to create and develop for Virtual Reality projects using Unity and HTC Vive. Some of the tutorials will apply for Oculus and other devices, but it is geared all towards the Vive.

## Getting Started
You will need to ensure you have the following installed before continuing with the tutorials. While much of the same information can be found in the powerpoints, This will help you set up and configure a terminal for you to get and obtain this repository as well as pushing your own repos to github.
It is also worth mentioning that this is for **Windows** and **Mac/OSx** users only as support for development on Linux is fully supported and requires use of wine/emulation.

### What You Need
Depending on your system, you may need to download additional software. You will require the following:
 * [Unity](https://store.unity.com/products/unity-personal?_ga=2.89237214.490171809.1550457455-987882329.1548438669)
 * [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com/us/)
 * [Steam/SteamVR](https://www.store.steampowered.com/)
   * Make sure you have created a Steam account, it is necessary
 * [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   * [git For Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
   * A GitHub account, which you already have
   
### Cloning the Repository
Much of what is covered here will assume you are familiar with using UNIX commands, but I will briefly cover them as we move forward. That being said, in your terminal window, enter the following commands:
```shell
mkdir Unity_Intro
cd Unity_Intro
git clone https://github.com/NIU-Computer-Science/VR-Tutorial.git
```
When you reach the *git clone* step, a GitHub window should open, prompting you to login. This will create a keychain with your device and your account, allowing you to pull and push towards github repositories.

### Repository Contents
Inside of the new directory you have downloaded, you will see an array of powerpoints and project folders. The names of both line up with each other in an effort to direct you through each tutorial. Bear in mind that the project folder is the **END RESULT OF EACH TUTORIAL**

## How to Follow Tutorials
The best way to follow along will be to do as the tutorial says to alongside your own work. As you work through part 0 (Hello World!), use the Part 0 project folder as a reference for how it should turn out by the end. The tutorials will cover the basic essentials and try to encompass all needs, but there is a lot of potential for ideas not addressed or covered in this course.

### Advice
 * It may help to have DUAL monitors while following the tutorials. Additionally, this will allow you to do coding on one screen with Unity open on the opposite.
   * You could open up the power point on another device to get a similar benefit of not sharing the same screen with various windows
 * If your version of Unity differs from that used in the tutorial, generally speaking it shouldn't be an issue, but I would strong suggest that you use the latest version when possible.
 * The tutorials were developed on a Windows 10 Machine. It is possible that some of the steps may differ on a Mac, but I have not tested for this. I will try to accomodate as I can, but they should line up the same.
